## Plan

### App Flow

- A user, unregistered visits the app.
- It is better to show some stuff of the app.
    - What's going on inside the app essentially. Some recent to-rent books.
    - Can't access the functionality like renting/etc. Just viewing/browsing
- Registration
    - Register as owner/renter
- If owner, a different set of portal is opened
    - can rent books, etc. CRUD stuff
    - content limited to owner
- If renter, a different one is opened
    - can view all books rented by all owners (shown for unregistered users)
    - renter's renting data

Routes management and design??
